Here are five mistakes in the resume and how to fix them:

1. Formatting Issues (Spacing & Readability)
The resume lacks clear section separation, and the spacing makes it difficult to read.
Fix: Add spacing between sections and use bullet points effectively.
2. Lack of Details in Work Experience
Phrases like "Managed various projects successfully" and "Worked with several teams" are vague.
Fix: Add quantifiable achievements (e.g., "Led a team of 10 developers, improving project delivery speed by 30%").
3. Education Section is Incomplete
"Bachelor’s in Computer Science – University of Los Angeles" is missing the graduation year.
Fix: Add the graduation year for consistency (e.g., "Bachelor’s in Computer Science – University of Los Angeles, 2012-2016").
4. Skills Section Needs More Technical Depth
The skills section is broad, lacking depth in technical expertise.
Fix: Add specific technologies like "React.js, Node.js, MongoDB" to highlight relevant experience.
5. Missing Professional Summary
The resume jumps straight into experience without an introduction.
Fix: Add a 2-3 sentence summary at the top, highlighting expertise and career goals.
